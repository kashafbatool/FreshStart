Project Description
Our project is trying to ensure that when students are starting off their college careers, they have a one stop solution in which they can get all information that they need. Our intended users are initially the trico community but in future we do wish to expand it further on to other institutions. Also, another part of this chatbot is to aid international students in particular regarding any worries they might have. 

Protoype Summary
We made the user interface using figma in order to be able to actually see our goal. Then, basic javascript was used for the chatbot. After some research on user intrefaces, we were also able to integrate the react library into our code. However, we both have no experience in using this library becasue of which its use was limited to the basic level only. Through futher research we were also able to identify areas of improvement in backend, databse, ai, data extraction and deployement.

Next Steps
While we are satisified with our idea, we need to imporve greatly on the technical part of it because of whihc we will be trying to get more tudents on board who have a stronger coding experience. We are also self leanring as we go ahead and are hopeful that we will be able to improve on the technological flawas in the future ourselves as well.
